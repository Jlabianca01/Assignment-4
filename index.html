          <p>Hello my name is Joseph LaBianca, I am currently a senior at UAlbany
            and will be grauating in the Fall of 2022. My major is Computer Science with 
            a Mathimatics minor. I have always loved computers and always wanted to know how they worked.
            I have always said that in the future everything is going to be run on computer and if you don't know
            what they are saying then you are going to be lost. The languages that I currently know are Java and C. I am 
            also teaching myself Python. I am also learning Javascript, CSS, React, HTML, AWS and Bootstrap this semster 
            which is going to help me in the future with getting a full time job.
          </p>
